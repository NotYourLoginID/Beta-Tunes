    <span>Sittin' in that hallowed hall, in eighteen thirty nine.</span> <br>
    <span>Eight men founded a fraternity, the greatest of all time.</span> <br>
    <span>One man named John Reily Knox, looked into their eyes.</span> <br>
    <span>He said "Brothers won't you sing with me?"</span> <br>
    <span>And this is what they cried:</span> </p>

    <span>And still we all marched on.</span> </p>
  <p> <br>
    <span>One day we will be the best, is what he said back then.</span> <br>
    <span>Boy, if he could see us now, the stars would shine again.</span> <br>
    <span>Listen son, I'm passing down, the spirit that I know.</span> <br>
